## Cursor Rules Structure

### Description
This rule defines the standard structure and location for all Cursor rules. Cursor rules are markdown files that provide documentation and guidance for the AI assistant.

### Rule Details
- All Cursor rules must be stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory
- All rule files must use the `.mdc` extension (Markdown Cursor)
- All rules must begin with a level 2 heading (##)
- Subsequent sections should use level 3 (###), 4 (####), and 5 (#####) headings as needed
- Rules are organized into three categories:
  1. Global rules (`.cursor/rules/global/`)
     - Apply to all projects
     - Define universal standards and patterns
  2. Project rules (`.cursor/rules/project/`)
     - Specific to individual projects
     - Define project-specific patterns and requirements
  3. Personal rules (`.cursor/rules/personal/`)
     - User-specific preferences and patterns
     - Define individual coding style and preferences

### Implementation
When creating new rules:
1. Determine the appropriate category (global/project/personal)
2. Create the rule file in the corresponding directory
3. Use the `.mdc` extension
4. Begin the file with a level 2 heading (##)
5. Use proper heading hierarchy for subsections
6. Follow the standard markdown format

### Examples
```markdown
## Example Rule Title

### Section One
Content for section one

#### Subsection
Content for subsection

### Section Two
Content for section two
```

### Notes
- Always verify the category of a rule before creating it
- If the category is unclear, ask the user to specify which category the rule belongs to
- Maintain consistent naming conventions within each category
- Keep rules focused and specific to their category
- Always start with level 2 heading (##)
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (## -> ### -> #### -> #####)
