1. User initiates by stating they want to save a personal rule
2. Assistant asks which rule file to save
3. Assistant uses save_personal_rule.sh script to:
   - Copy the rule to ~/.cursor/rules/personal/
   - Create a symlink in .cursor/rules/personal/
   - Handle existing files/symlinks appropriately

## Example Interaction
User: "I want to save my new personal rule"
Assistant: "Which rule file would you like to save?"
User: "my_custom_rule.mdc"
Assistant: "I'll help you save that rule. Let me run the script for you."

## Dependencies
