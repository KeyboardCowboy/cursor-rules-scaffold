# Cursor Rules Scaffold Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create a scaffold for managing cursor rules across different levels (global, project, and personal) with proper documentation and examples.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Directory Structure Setup
- Created `.cursor/rules/` directory for project-level rules
- Created `.cursor/rules/personal/` for personal rules
- Set up memory-bank for documentation and templates
- Added `.gitignore` to exclude memory bank and personal `.mdc` files

### 2. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `memory-bank/docs/`
  - `cursor-rules.md`: Explains the rules system
  - `rule-creation.md`: Guide for creating new rules
- Added example rule in `memory-bank/examples/`
- Created rule template in `memory-bank/templates/`

### 3. Rule Management
- Implemented three-tier rule system:
  - Global rules (system-wide)
  - Project rules (`.cursor/rules/`)
  - Personal rules (`.cursor/rules/personal/`)
- Created basic rule template structure
- Added example code formatting rule

## Current State
The scaffold is now ready for use with:
- Clear directory structure
- Documentation and examples
- Template for creating new rules
- Proper gitignore configuration
- Support for all three rule levels

## Next Steps
1. Create more example rules for common use cases
2. Add validation for rule syntax
3. Consider adding a rule testing framework
4. Create documentation for rule inheritance and precedence

## Notes
- Personal rules are git-ignored but folder structure is preserved
- Memory bank is excluded from version control
- Project can be used as a template for new projects
